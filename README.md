## Key Features

- Classic Snake gameplay: Control the snake, collect food, and avoid collisions.
- Responsive keyboard controls for seamless gaming.
- Dynamic scoring and high score tracking.
- Game over and restart functionality.
- Randomized food placement for replayability.
- Customizable board size to suit your preference.

## How to Play

1. Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to navigate the snake.
2. Guide the snake to consume the food items, which will increase its size and earn you points.
3. Avoid collisions with walls and the snake's own body, as hitting them results in a game over.
4. Aim to achieve the highest score and compete with your friends for the top spot on the leaderboard.
