## Key Features

- Classic Snake gameplay: Control the snake, collect food, and avoid collisions.
- Responsive keyboard controls for seamless gaming.
- Dynamic scoring and high score tracking.
- Game over and restart functionality.
- Randomized food placement for replayability.
- Customizable board size to suit your preference.

## How to Play

1. Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to navigate the snake.
2. Guide the snake to consume the food items, which will increase its size and earn you points.
