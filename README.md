# Snake-Game
Welcome to the Classic Snake Game repository! This project is a Java-based implementation of the timeless classic arcade game "Snake." It provides a fun and nostalgic gaming experience where players control a snake, guiding it to consume food while avoiding collisions with walls and its own tail.
